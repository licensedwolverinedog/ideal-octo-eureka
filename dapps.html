    <h1>Dapps

<p class="lead"> Dynamic Security/Content and Distributed applications</p>

    <p class-"lead">   What are the biggest practical barriers to dapps adoption?</p>

<p> First I think dapps ar ethe future for certain uses cases that involve law and contracts. There's simply no escape. The barrier I believe currently is one of imagination and development resources. We have built a world dependent on bleeding edge performance from private computer layers that are all in well established languages in well established cloud services and everyone is making single page web apps in javascript. Blockchain is new and has real world consequences for coding errors that we are just begining to understand. DAPPS as a model are brand spanking new relative to the rest of traditional computing. </p>

<p> The first context to consider is adopted by who? Businesses, organizations or consumers? Each has reasons why but if our goal is to maximize the benfits, let's start with organizations (which could be a for profit instituion, a board or a government). Accountability has not been a key value in most of these systems. The primary benefit largely of the blockchain is enforcable rules and accountability without manipulation. This is against the current cultural incentives for many organizations in private and public space. Subterfuge is sometimes legitimate, as a means to a moral or ethical end for an organization to accomplish a good but assuming for a moment the negative, most people would agree that accountability and trust are lacking in either our governments or the nation's largest organizations. </p>

<p> This brings in the notion of true risk: the person or organization who has the first effective dapps vision, will be more like the penguin pushed into the sea to check for seals, then the next Mark Zuckerberg. We're re-inventing the wheel and that means viewing this emergin technology from a web 1.0 historical lens: we're just at Mosiac and Netscape is around the corner. We won't see dapps adoption meaningfully for the next 6-20 years, depending on how history shapes up. It will be slow and steady asymmetric risks, followed by new information, changes, corrections, all leading to an eventual blockchain based ( but not only) future. </p>

<p> The blockchain is a value question and not a a technology choice. It is technology that can enable trutful people to be honest. That still has value but it needs to start where the risk is limited and exposure to career ending disasters are low. </p>

<p> There are opportunities in climate change that dapps are ripe for</p>
<ul> 
<li> measurements of overall carbon emissions givin a validated oracle that all nations can agree to </li>
<li> measurements of animal and plant stocks given a validated oracle that all intereested parties can agree to </li> 
<li> measuring water purificaition levels in the wake of Michigan's lead water disaaster. </li>
<li> measurement of electrical usage within a system as a measurement of renewable powers </li>
<li> general energy sector trading to avoid a repeat of the enron scandal. </li>
</ul>
<p> These distributed applications are not neccessarily interesting but they play a role in emphasizing the best features of the blockchain: public,auditable state and in the needed incubator of a risk free (read: career ending for leaders) zone. </p> 

<p> For consumers, the blockchain plays a religious role ( it is trustworthy, it is effective) but this is also eroded by the false promises of crypto currency markets. Instead of treating the distributrred app features as a benefit, dapps must prove their worth to consumers through their own ingeniuty while maintaining high performance standards. An easy way to do this is to switch away from Javascript/nodejs/eletron apps and return to binaries which interact with  appropiate near (low latentcy) nodes. While not a panacea, this is competitive with current application performance without the cost of rendering and costly repeated calls to distributed systems over the web, instead relying on local caching of content.  </p>

<p> Unfortuantely for dapp content creators, most ideas are pretty good in their current form. Facebook competitors like Ello and Mastadon, have succeedded in drawing interested parties but not the general public. The exception that would come to mind is Parler but that has decided that "bullet proof hosting" most likely due to developer time and resources. Without a second controversial exist of a popular app from web2 to web3, it's hard to make the use case that consumer require or need web3 intervention. </p>

<p> there is a second context that should be considered which is how blockchain dependent is your dapp? Currently Fleek does accomplish mixing both models to achieve system integration. There is nothing neccessarily wrong with say, an azure functions exclusive application which writes to a blockchain as its storage medium. It's just less resilient as it relies on centralization resources. A parallel would be our strong federal government and contrast of states.  </p>

<p> 


<p class-"lead">   What are the security advantages and disadvantages of dapps?</p> 
<p> This is difficult to answer since we're still in early days! But we can consider the general history of trusted computing with current examples of dapps and play with some variables. This also depends on the contexts above ( audience vs degree of decentralized) but let's play with absolutely decentralized for conversation. </p>
<p> Advantages
<ul>
<li>Dapps are outage resilient. A google docs like program where simultaneous edits can occur, can be updated while nodes are online the Internet or off the internet but within reach of an availble node. </li>
<li> Dapps are future proofed for ipv6 and 5G. In a future where networking is simplfified ( rmeoving the distinction between wan and lan) and 5g towers allow for proper cell coverage, dapps can maintain a prescence very easily. The absolute loss of an existing network or nodes need not be problematic in a dapp running on ipv6 with ipv6 accessible clients.  </li>
<li> Dapps promote good security habits through leaning the user in to asymetric keys instead of password authentication </li>
<li> 

<p>disadvantages: <p>
<ul>
<li>We are unprepared for the consequences of javascript UIs accessing or talking to smart contracts ( https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat). While the interpretaiton of the smart contract may be considered absolute javascript is a nightmare to allow for touching anything of the sort. It needs heavy auditing and quaranting to match the security values of the blockchain. We could find that poor implementation of javascript security standards (easy to do) can lead to faulty or hacked inputs provided to smart contracts which then execute. </li>
<li> dapps are "announced" and cannot be obfuscated effectively. By contrast, you can run cryptpad ( https://cryptpad.fr/ ) on private computers with private storage and provided they are not connected to the internet, your documents cannot be accessed. </li>
<li> footprints: no matter how anonymous, the public blockchain can be analyzed and your identity lead to through sufficient statistical analysis (pseudo-anonmity). </li> 
<li> ddos & queue abuse: DApps (currently) are reliant on the ethereum mainnet which has in the past been vulnerable to DDoS attacks through amplification of requests. Similar to the instability of a single program memory leak on a multi-program computer. https://securityintelligence.com/news/ethereum-ddos-attack-abuses-internal-attributes/ </li>
<li> potential of sandbox escaping: If we think about a dapp as a process which runs on a computer called ethereum, basic process protection would be to sandbox and prevent processes from seeing each other's internal memory. By contrast, the ethereum mainnet is built for performance and consistentcy but not neccessarily for privacy ( due to the advantage of the public blockchain). Depending on the architecture of authentication, there may be tokens, password hashes or other critical identifiers or secrets that are used on the blockchain as a means of establishing user identity (or simply are user data) that may be accessible from other dapps that can bypass security measures. A slightly related example is available here: https://keys.lol/ethereum </li>
</ul>

<p class-"lead"> How might the role of a traditional system administrator change in a business organization that made use of dapps?</p> 
<p> The system administrators goal is to ensure application uptime and configuration according to business rules. The system administrator of the dapp future would know more about the business and the implications of business decision making ( similar to low code workflow specialists) and be concerned less with hardware or software performance optimization (except of course as a matter of business ( say that if a certain risk rule is adjusted for applications of credit, the overall credit process would be quicker as a smart contract)). New tools for measurement would be required to identify performance barriers to business processes and auditability of those processes to produce a valueable result. Communication, critical thinking and definition of problems and solutions accross different knowledge domains ( skills most system adminstrators do have) would be required. </p>
<p> If we were to compare a like for like, let's think about a theoretical quickbooks online versus a quickbooks online dapps version. In either event, the system administrator in the cloud version is unable to effectively control performance. They can influence it through potential gains (zscaler or "faster" internet) but in general, application maintenance is on the SaaS provider. If a distributed application were to "go down", in its current context that would be a halt for the Ethereum ecosystem (as happend with cryptokitties) and therefore measurements of scalability and performance may be required to assess overall environment health for all ethereum applications. A system administrator of this dapp world, may be required to be held liable or accountable for performance on the ethereum mainnet for their poorly written dapp, similar to tenants being held for maintianing a clean apartment building. </p>
<p> Lastly, the system administrator of the future needs to consider context and trust according to known mentrics. This would include other blockchain networks similar to multi-cloud architectures, knowledge of appropiate orcale uses and their weakenses. Enforceability of smart contracts according to jurisidction (although this could be in part automated similar to an IDE linter.) </p>


<p class-"lead">  Is it possible to manage dapps for a team of users like
we might with traditional SaaS business applications? If so, how might it be done? If not, what are the implications for organizational dapp use?</p>

<p> Yes, the simplest implementation can be done with the assignment of primary (administrative) keys which control shared access keys. The primary keys would be assigned to control shared access keys which would be distributed to a set of users who have their own keys. The simplest gatekeeper mechanism would be a shared key that is given to a group to access the application, followed by the individual key the user uses to authenticate as themselves and then either provide encrypted data or sign public data. Assuming the ownership/permissions of the initial shared key is "owned" by the primary key, the system administrator responsible for that key would simply change the shared key and only reveal to the "surviving" members. ( Apologies for using the word key so many times). In theory, this kind of trust is not terribly different from joining a computer to a domain in active directory or how shared access signatures work in azure: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview ). This is talked about in a more eloquent form by Vitalik in social recovery wallets: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html </p>


<p> If the question is how do we as an organization of consenting individuals each with the same level of trust and vote, become a truly decentralized without even an authoratitive source to change us, a purely democract business SaaS doesn't quite make sense. The SaaS dapp must by design match the organizational hierarchy.  Even communism had Stalin! </p>

<p> Let's assume we want a revolutionairy application which truly decentralizes decision making and yet still allows for some control mechanisms. The simplest would be to set a smart contract for ownership based on a series of metrics that must be maintained by agreed upon oracles. By example an orcale that refers to a timecard system could note that an employee was late three times and then destroy/overwrite the membership of the employee to the organization. The difficulty of constructing that legally depends on the laws of the state (duh) but at will employement is fairly open. At the very least, Uber has provided this whiplash employment to its drivers historically, so automating it is within the realm of the possible. In the realm of a dapp, this could be that a dapp access to be self-administrative according to a smart contract (i.e. 3 wrong password entries performs a block of access smart contract that suspends the user until a timer has passed (again using an oracle for the timer).</p>

<p> An easy model to follow would be to compare put draft employee handbook as a smart contract for an organization. After drafting, the question should be put to those responsible for leading the organization: what oracles are acceptable to detect or enforce the employee handbook? For those that are unenforceable, what oracle measures can be used to identify reasonable decisions (i.e. you cannot use an oracle to ensure that breastfeeding mothers can use a private space. You can however put a certification that a room has been created according to a trusted third party who builds private rooms for breastfeeding mothers that it is created and private.). Once computed, the handbook smart contract should go through a test to validate oracles and contracts. Once a certification finishes, it is implemented with decision makers included for human intervention in smart contract results to validate all is working according to plan. </p>

<p> The above mixture of a real world example of a smart contract, first the creation of a sufficient agreed upon rule base and then thorough testing would be the most web3 version of constructing security controls enforced programmatically. The creation of these rules which then have an agent decide what to perform is the most effective model of creating fair rules which still involve human determination as to the impact. People still get passwords wrong without malicious intent, the administrator of the dapp has a responsobility and a role to play in ensuring consistent and official access is maintained. The difference here is the rules are not proprietary implementations ( active directory, okta) but comparable logic.  </p>
