    <p class-"lead">   What are the biggest practical barriers to dapps adoption?</p>
    <p class-"lead"> Initial Trust and Practical utility of private computing
    <p class-"lead"> Initial Trust </p>
    <p> The initial trust of DAPPS is reflective in the current low stakes , low utility level of applications (see cryptokitties). While this is because this method of thinking is entirely new, it reflects that people are not interested in immedaitely moving say, rocket mortgage to the blockchain. Transitions are difficult to pull wihtout regulatory hurdles and it is unknown what the consequences would be for those who built on a web2 model to move their data to entirely public blockchains. Real world assets will move carefully and slowly to the blockchain but will be assisted if initial trust can be accelerated. The lack of initial trust however will prevent real world assets from being added to dapps and consequently, reduce their utilitiy. </p>
    
    <p>The rhetorical appeal of decentralized  is huge, translating that to meaningful trust and change is difficult and involves consulting the exact same professional classes blockchain proposes to disrupt (large law ,accounting and consulting firms). The initial trust requires middle ground services that are able to utilize the technology and show its benefit uniquely, to encourage new consulting of how to transition. Social media marketing would be nothing without social media marketers and influencers. </p>
    
    <p>Cryptocurrencies have a rich speculator (no pun intended) community that is diverse and is interested in the highs and lows of price changes and the security products are intriguing and interesting. </p>
    
    <p>The promise of dapps is organizational and social. Its customers are implied to be organizations, not neccessarily individuals. If your goal is a smart contract about an asset you own, say the ownership to your car, you can add a copy of it to the blockchain but it won't be recognized by a present legal authority or business authority except as a copy, not as the absolute document to be referred upon. This is due to the exisiting legal consensus of where a document of ownership of a car resides (with the state in the United States) and not with the individual no matter how well intentioned or effective the technology. The most effective digital camera copy is nothing compared to the cheap printing of a title. </p>
    
    <p>If however institutions or organizations saw a "first move advantage" that their move to dapps would put them ahead of their competition, the would work to do so. Banks have a a natural incentive to transition cash transactions to a "Fed coin" and reduce their IT costs. By contrast, legal ownership "fuzziness" (lost documents, missing documents, unavaialble customer support) around mortgages and other documents however is advantageous by keeping the transaction one sided. </p>
    
    A first move advantage event could be:
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>A nation state declares all legal documents must be moved to the blockchain and as a result adoption increases due to economic partners who own assets or transact in that nation state. </li>
    <li> A humanitarian crises that occurs in a disputed territory and all manner of evidence is considered in a trial, raising the utility and legal evidence introduction of blockchain data. </li>
    <li> A popular social media app, to prevent being blocked, establishes a failover IPFS accessible site that is kept consistent and declares it cannot be blocked, challenging others. </li> 
    </ul>
    These are all theoretical but large spectacles which result in attention and movement were successful in the dot com boom when technological progress was higher than consumer utility. Dot com boom companies weren't wrong, just early. Consumer acceptance however, made the dotcoms successful. 
    
    <p class-"lead"> Practical utility of private computing </p>
    <p> Private computing (the asset infrastructure of web 2.0) has predictable and consistent high performance. This is relatively easy to acquire and consult with a number of people who how to implement additioanl purchases of say cloud services. This ease of implementation by consultants and known performance, allows middle management to easily accomplish business objectives against customer desires. </p>
    <p> By comparison to public computing on web3, performance is not neccessarily guaranted as work is processed and consultations for best practices in security & implementation are not readily available.  </p>
 
    
    <p> Both of these answers, initial trust and practical utility, are capable of being answered by product design with a customer in mind. Making PVC pipes is valuable to society only if those downstream know what to do with them.</p>
