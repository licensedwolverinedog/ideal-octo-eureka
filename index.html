    <h1>My IPFS Blog.</h1>
    <p class="lead"> My name is MH and I'm an IT AVP at a Credit Union.</p>
    <p>I've worked in IT in the San Francisco Bay Area for 7 years, starting as a low level tech performing customer service and small/medium sized businesses assistance for an MSP while going to community college in the evening. As my experience and confidence grew, I applied to OpenDNS now Cisco Umbrella as an internship, learned a good deal, and moved back into the MSP space before being offered a position at my current location after excellent performance on contract to my current Credit Union. At the CU, I started with 2 employees and now lead 5 seperated in two departments. We've done 12 years of technical achievements (clearing technical debt of 20+ years, data center migrations and core conversions) in around 3 years. </p>
    
    <p> My interest in web3 started not with Bitcoin but with Ethereum. Working at the credit union, I've seen (unfortunately) human error from everything to taxes to mortgae rates for loans. Worse, due to the regulations of the mortgage industry, most mortgages are in fact re-sold to mortgage servicing companies to keep the documentation and consistenty of the remaining balance. Unfortunately this leads to confusion for the membership, as error-prone human issues can cause difficult to correct problems that continue to have financial impacts. Seeing the mass of intellectual and regulatory effort to simply create the contract, attach the documents, sign in triplicate before any computational effort was done, the idea of smart contracts is revolutionairy. If the goal is to reduce the amount of manipulation and distortion caused simply be accidents, let alone malicious actors, smart contracts allow for simplifing what is a complex mess at the best of times by boiling down a sea of paperwork and digital services to a known entity. </p>

    <p>  Looking at the data center we had built out to sustain high availbility and perform money, document and contract management, this all became irrelevant in the face of smart contracts. Why hold on to severeal thousand driver's licenses and depend on an evetual audit or fidning to correct expired ones? Why rely on installing anti-virus, anti-spyware, establishing firewalls, NACs, when you can just run one program (the ethereum miner) and you have a working node. </p>

    <p> This lead to my final interst in web3: If there is a war or outage, the technical connnections between the services on the back end in financial instituions, depend on humans operating every portion of the stack effecticely. But that conflicts with the natural financial incentives to outsource technical labor to efficient MSPs. What should be simple hardware issues corrected by high availbility, is in truth a cluster of knowledge and staff requirements to be kept absolutely consistent in the event of an disaster or war. By contrast, as long as two ethereum nodes are up , transactions can occur without specialized operator knowledge past basic networking. Operators are only needed to scale and maintain basic hardware functionality with very cheap and easy to operate miners, far below the cost of maintaining secure private computing facilities.
