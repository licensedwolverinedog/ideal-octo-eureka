    <h1>My IPFS Blog.</h1>
    <p class="lead"> My name is MH and I'm an IT AVP at a Credit Union.</p>
    <p>I've worked in IT in the San Francisco Bay Area for 7 years, starting as a low level tech performing customer service and small/medium sized businesses assistance for an MSP while going to community college in the evening. As my experience and confidence grew, I applied to OpenDNS now Cisco Umbrella as an internship, learned a good deal, and moved back into the MSP space before being offered a position at my current location after excellent performance on contract to my current Credit Union. At the CU, I started with 2 employees and now lead 5 seperated in two departments. We've done 12 years of technical achievements (clearing technical debt of 20+ years, data center migrations and core conversions) in around 3 years. </p>
    
    <p> My interest in web3 started not with Bitcoin but with Ethereum. Working at the credit union, I've seen (unfortunately) the cost of human error. I was suprised to learn that due to the regulations of the mortgage industry, most mortgages are in fact re-sold to mortgage servicing companies to keep the documentation and consistenty of the remaining balance. Unfortunately this leads to confusion for the membership, as error-prone humans can cause difficult to correct problems that don't appear on the paper documents but do appear in the computer system. Seeing the mass of intellectual and regulatory effort to simply create the contract, attach the documents, sign in triplicate before any computational effort was done, the idea of smart contracts is revolutionairy. If the goal is to reduce the amount of manipulation and distortion caused simply be accidents, let alone malicious actors, smart contracts allow for simplifing what is a complex mess at the best of times by boiling down a sea of paperwork and digital services to a known entity. By contrast to creating two contracts, one digital and one in paper, a smart contract starts digital and stays consistent, without requirement of operators.</p>

    <p>  Looking at the data center we had built out to , with advanced networking, storage and computer, it seemed almost wasteful. We had member documents ( identification cards, statements, loans) in one application/database. Mortgage servicing was a seperate vendor and seperate communication. So on and so forth, a series of seperate entities that are meant to represent a whole for a member of statements, documents and transactions. But the web of connections required is large and each connection point needs consistent auditing, access controls and reviews. Its a model similar to the old days before virtualization of operating systems, highly manual and dependent on checklists and sweat. </p>

    <p> This lead to my final interest in web3: If there is a war or outage, the technical connnections between the services on the back end in financial instituions, depend on humans operating every portion of the stack effecticely. But that conflicts with the natural financial incentives to outsource technical labor to vendors and partners. The glue that holds that together are key personnel who in turn need to coordinate all activities to recover.</p>

    <p>Imagine (a bit down) if a missile by a nation state hit a credit union and it's local area. Regardless of backups, if a sufficient amount of staff were lost, transactions and balances would be lost for weeks. Each of these credit unions, tend to have sufficient disaster recovery capabilities but are highly manual, depending on credit union affordable software. </p>
    
    <p> What should be simple hardware loss corrected by purchasing and configuring more devices, is in truth a cluster of knowledge and staff requirements to be kept absolutely consistent in the event of an disaster or war. By contrast, as long as two ethereum nodes are up , transactions can occur without specialized operator knowledge past basic networking. Operators are only needed to scale and maintain basic hardware functionality with very cheap and easy to operate miners, far below the cost of maintaining secure private computing facilities. By combining that with specialized boards using ASICS optimized for transactions and operating system hardening, miners take an entire half century of banking technology and boil it down to a single unit, equivilant to a financial circuit breaker. 
    </p>


    <p> Web3 in my mind is not the story of crytpocurrencies but from multi-program computers ot highly specialized computers with programs whose domains are well understood and expected. This reduction effect removes the ambiguity that has plagued organizations looking for simple answers to solve the problems they exist in the first place to solve. The issues of a non-profit should not be how to optimizez Windows licensing or how to continue to have a bloated product line of seemingly ineffective security software. All the wasted compute will be gone and in its place will be computers that either store (blockchain) or interpret ( AI) or do (IoT). </p>
